Push Swap Project 🔄

The "Push Swap" project 🔄 is a challenging algorithm task in C 🖥️. Your objective is to create a program called push_swap that sorts a set of integers using a specified set of instructions. It's more than just sorting; it's about understanding sorting algorithms 🤔 and their complexity 📊. The project emphasizes precision in memory management 🧠 and error handling 🚫. Your program must efficiently sort the integers with the fewest possible operations, meeting strict benchmarks 📈.

Bonus Part 🌟

For the bonus part, it's all about creating a checker that takes the same set of integers and waits for the user's instructions. Each instruction is applied to the integers, and then the checker verifies whether these instructions have sorted the numbers. If yes, it prints "OK" ✅; if not, it prints "KO" ❌.
